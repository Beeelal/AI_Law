<center><p>As we know, hiring a lawyer can get pretty expensive in Pakistan. Two non-technical investors thought of an idea to create an AI-based lawyer that can process textual queries and answer them accordingly with citations to the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) and Constitution. This is especially useful for people living in remote areas and even urban women looking to get a consultation privately. This website will help you to answer any query you have about any of your issue. It will give you answer according to the Pakistan Penal Code, so all of the answers will be accurate.</p></center>
