		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p class="grey-text">Hiring a lawyer can get pretty expensive in Pakistan. Two non-technical investors thought of an idea to create an AI-based lawyer that can process textual queries and
		answer them accordingly with citations to the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) and
		Constitution. This is especially useful for people living in remote areas and even
		urban women looking to get a consultation privately
